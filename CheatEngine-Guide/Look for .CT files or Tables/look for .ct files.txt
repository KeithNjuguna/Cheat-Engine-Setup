How to Look for .CT Files
Cheat Table (.CT) files are commonly shared by communities of modders, game hackers, and Cheat Engine users. Here's how to find them:

1. Online Communities and Forums
Cheat Engine Forums – The official Cheat Engine forums (https://forum.cheatengine.org/) are a great place to find pre-made .CT files for a variety of games.
Gaming Forums & Subreddits – There are many communities, such as those on Reddit (e.g., /r/cheatengine), where users share their .CT files. Be sure to check for specific games or cheat requests.
Modding Websites – Some websites dedicated to modding (e.g., Nexus Mods or GameCopyWorld) may offer .CT files for popular games.
2. Cheat Engine Tables Websites
Cheat Engine Table Websites – Some websites are dedicated to hosting Cheat Engine tables. Searching for your game + “Cheat Table” in Google can help find sites that host .CT files.
Popular sites include:
FearLess Cheat Engine (https://fearlessrevolution.com/)
Cheat Engine Database (https://www.cheatengine.org/)
3. Custom .CT Files
Create Your Own – If you’re unable to find a .CT file for a specific game, you can create your own by following tutorials on Cheat Engine to locate memory addresses and save them into a cheat table. This process involves:
Scanning for the value you want to change in Cheat Engine.
Narrowing down the memory addresses.
Saving the address with the cheat as a .CT file for future use.
4. Torrent and File Sharing Websites
While less reliable, torrent or file-sharing sites may host .CT files shared by others. Be cautious when downloading files from unofficial sources to avoid malware.
5. Search Engines
Use search engines like Google with specific queries like:
“Game Name cheat engine table”
“Game Name .CT file download”
“Game Name cheats Cheat Engine”
For example: "Skyrim cheat engine table .CT download" or "The Witcher 3 Cheat Engine table."
6. Discord Communities
Many Discord servers dedicated to specific games or Cheat Engine may share custom-made .CT files. Join the relevant server and check their pinned messages or file-sharing channels.
How to Verify the Safety of .CT Files
Be Cautious – Only download .CT files from trusted sources to avoid potential malware or viruses.
Antivirus Scans – Always scan downloaded files with an antivirus before opening them.
Community Feedback – Check feedback or comments from other users to ensure the .CT file works as intended and doesn’t have malicious code.
